# Villages
##What's that?
Villages is my first real C++ game. It's an indie tower defense game and is in early development right now.

##What to expect?
For now, don't expect too much. The graphics are bad (I really can't draw), and only about 2% of the actual game machanics are implemented.
But feel free to clone the repo and send me some nice pull requests!

##Still sounds cool, I want to have it!
No problem! Just download the repo and run make all to compile. You will get an executable that's called game. The  just run it. For now it doesn't create a menu entry.
                                           --------

##What about the dependencies?
Regarding the makefile you should be able to make tem up by yourself, but I'm kind and will (try to) list them here (don't cry if I forget one, this might happen due to the active stage of development):
-SDL2 (SDL 1 will NOT work and you will need SDL_image too)
-FTGL (for rendering text in OpenGL)

That's it (at least, i hope)

##PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS DEVELOPED AND TESTED UNDER LINUX
I CANNOT GIVE SUPPORT TO WINDOWS AND MAC USERS (although the game still should work)
IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO AFTER DOWNLOADING THE REPO, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU (at least for now)
